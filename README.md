# mutliplayer-game-engine


The project was made purely for exploring real-time network applications, the project began in Jan-2014, and have been slowly progressing for a year until school and work took most of my time.

Application uses Java 1.7, but can also be set to run with Java 1.5.

The program helped me explore the designs more complex program architectures, as well as multi-threading and realtime network flow control.
