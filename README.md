# mutliplayer-game-engine


This project was made purely for exploring real-time network applications, the project began in Jan-2014 and slowly progressed for a year until school and work took most of my time.  This application demonstrates an exploration into the designs of more complex program architectures, as well as multi-threading and realtime network flow control.

Application uses Java 1.7, but can also be set to run with Java 1.5.
